## Day 4 Saturday

There is a cold mountain breeze blowing this morning. I wake up early and start preparing breakfast. Instant oats with honey and tea. Washing up makes your hands feel like they have frostbite. Someone makes a comment in the line of: "Isn't this Georgia?". Its uncommonly cold for this time of the year. We pack up and start making our way to the Lance Creek campsite. We cannot camp any more to the north since a bear canister is required for the stretch between Jarrard Gap and Neel's Gap. Arriving early after hiking at a brisk pace, we set up a clothing line and wash some clothes. We greet the hikers as they arrive. Some hikers walk with dogs carrying mini saddle packs with their own food in it, complete with matching fleece for the cold. Cute. Dennis arrives and camps close to us. He used to play tennis and had knee operations done due to related injuries. Also used to sail until he had a knock down and his wife got scared. I spot a Woodpecker after hearing his knocking sound. I wonder if he ever gets a headache from banging his head against a tree? Jurgen arrives and makes a comment about how fast Dennis walks. Weather forecast is -2 deg Celsius. We put on more clothes and sleep with our socks on. Sleeping bags in cocoon mode, ready as can be. I'm still hearing strange noises in the night... The socks we left on the line are frozen the next morning.
