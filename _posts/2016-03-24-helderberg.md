Helderberg mountain is almost literally in our backyard. We've hiked up the mountain many times - but this would be the first time we would walk (and sometimes climb) up the mountain with our fully loaded backpacks. Once again the weekend was upon us too quickly and we could not book a trail in one of the more remote nature reserves, nor did we feel up to driving several hours before starting a trail. In the end we really enjoyed it and promised ourselves to do this more often.

The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helderberg_Nature_Reserve) is a bit uninspiring and neither is the ["friends" website](http://www.helderbergnaturereserve.co.za), but at least it is informative. It's a pity, because for me the Helderberg beats Table mountain in many ways. 

The first 3km or so is on a steep jeep track but quite manageable. As you get closer to the dome though all hands and feet are required (especially with the big heavy backpacks).

Soon you are rewarded with breathtaking sea and mountain views.

We prepared hearty meal of bolognaise sauce and sausages...

and as evening came listened to the birds and looked down on the clouds coming in...

it was absolutely spectacular!

The next morning we walked down through the clouds...

...until eventually civilization started peeking through.

Looking back at the mountain, all fresh after a bit of evening rain.

We feel really priviledged to live in such a beautiful part of a beautiful country!
