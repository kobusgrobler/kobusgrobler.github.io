So last weekend we decided to test our gear and get some training in as well. This involved lugging along backpacks filled with everything needed to be self-sufficient. Tent, food, and the kitchen sink. Armed with a permit, we started off on the two day circular trail in the Boosmansbos Nature Reserve.

Some fotos from day 1 - walking uphill (mountain!) most of the time. The views were very rewarding.
