While we walk mostly for personal reasons (and fun!), we will be supporting one of our local charities, Community Keepers. Our pledge is to donate $1 for every mile we walk while on the Appalachian trail. If you would like to join us in supporting them, please let us know so that we can keep you up to date with our progress, but also mostly so that you can encourage us and that our Zero days (no walking) or Nero (near Zero days) will be kept to a minimum.

"**Even the biggest challenges seem smaller  when we take a step closer, roll up our  sleeves and take action**.
By investing in the social and emotional  well-being of learners, Community  Keepers create supportive school  communities where learning and  development can prosper.
We establish ourselves at schools,  where we deliver professional  services to learners, educators  and parents or guardians.
We build long-term relationships  and help
individuals, their families and communities,
**STEP UP**."
