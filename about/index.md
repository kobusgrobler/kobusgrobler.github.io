We heard about it, seen a bit and even walked a bit on the Appalachian trail. Now, this year, starting in April we would like to walk about half of the Appalacian trail. 

So bear with us (no pun intended, we'd really like to avoid these hairy guys!) as we prepare for our walk and get everything ready. We hope to share a lot of photos and experiences with you on this blog.
